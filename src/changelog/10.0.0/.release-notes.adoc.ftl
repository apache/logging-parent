    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

This minor release contains various improvements that we expect to relieve the load on `pom.xml` and GitHub Actions workflows of Maven-based projects we parent.
This is of particular importance while managing and cutting releases from multiple repositories.
See `README.adoc` for the complete list of features and their usage.

See https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j-tools/actions/runs/6120297528[this `log4j-tools` GitHub Actions workflow run] demonstrating a successful release cut using a SNAPSHOT version of this `logging-parent` release.
All preparations (release notes, source and binary distributions, vote & announcement emails, etc.) are staged to both Nexus and SVN and waiting the release manager to proceed.
