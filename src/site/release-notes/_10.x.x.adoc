    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-10-x-x]
=== 10.x.x



This minor release focuses on shipping AsciiDoc-based website generation convenience targeting the `src/site` folder.
As a part of this effort, `logging-parent` started publishing https://logging.apache.org/logging-parent[its own website] and `log4j-changelog` support is switched from Markdown to AsciiDoc.


==== Added

* Added `asciidoc` and `constants-tmpl-adoc` profiles to generate AsciiDoc-based websites from `src/site`
* Added support to auto-generate changelog entries for `dependabot` updates
* Started publishing https://logging.apache.org/logging-parent[the project website]

==== Changed

* Switched the default `log4j-changelog` configuration from Markdown (`.release-notes.md.ftl` and `.index.md.ftl`) to AsciiDoc (`.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and `.index.adoc.ftl`)
* Update `com.google.errorprone:error_prone_core` to version `2.22.0`

==== Removed

* Removed `project.build.outputTimestamp` override since it is already provided by the parent POM and its old value `0` was causing https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/pull/37438[reproducibility issues] for `spring-boot:repackage`

==== Fixed

* Replaced incorrect `java.version` Maven property override with `maven.compiler.{source,release,target}`
