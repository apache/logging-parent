    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-10-x-x]
=== 10.x.x



This minor release contains several small improvements.


==== Added

* Added support for auto-generating CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

==== Changed

* Update `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-changelog-maven-plugin` to version `0.5.0`
* Update `log4j-changelog` XSD (used for validating changelog entries) to version `0.1.2`
* Update `actions/checkout` to version `4.1.1` (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/pull/48[1562197994])
* Update `com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-annotations` to version `4.8.0` (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/pull/44[1553835070])
* Update `github/codeql-action` to version `2.22.3` (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/pull/47[1558328036])
* Update `ossf/scorecard-action` to version `2.3.0` (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/pull/45[1553916310])

==== Fixed

* Moves `.flattened-pom.xml` to the same directory as `pom.xml` to preserve the relative parent path. This requires adding `.flattened-pom.xml` to the `.gitignore` file of the repository.
* Prioritize definitions in `bnd-extra-*` variables over those inherited (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/issues/39[#39])
* Keep parent in `flatten-bom` configuration (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/issues/37[37])
* Remove `build` in `flatten-bom` configuration
* Fixed the archiving of symbolically linked directories in the `distribution` Maven profile (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/issues/43[43])
* Used specific execution IDs in ``defaultGoal``s to avoid running unwanted plugins
