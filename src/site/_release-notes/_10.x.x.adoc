    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`
