    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-10-3-0]
=== 10.3.0

Release date:: 2023-11-06

This minor release contains several small improvements.


==== Added

* Add support to extend the `bnd-maven-plugin` configuration with `bnd-extra-config` property (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1895[apache/logging-log4j2#1895])
* Add support to replace `project.build.outputTimestamp` Maven property in CI (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/issues/50[50])
* Add XSLT transformation step to add a deterministic `serialNumber` and VDR links to the SBOM

==== Changed

* `deploy-release-reusable.yaml` is improved to automatically derive deployed artifacts as attachments. This renders both `distribution-attachment-filepath-pattern` and `distribution-attachment-count` input arguments redundant for almost all cases.
* Disable the usage of `<distributionManagement>` and alpha releases in the `bnd-baseline-maven-plugin`.
* Convert `bnd-maven-plugin` API leakage warnings to errors (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1895[apache/logging-log4j2#1895])
* Update `com.google.errorprone:error_prone_core` to version `2.23.0` (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/pull/49[49])
* Update `org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-maven-plugin` to version `2.7.10` (https://github.com/apache/logging-parent/pull/54[54])

==== Fixed

* Fix broken changelog entry validation
* Attach `flatten:clean` to `clean` phase
* Add missing `Implementation-` and `Specification-` entries in `MANIFEST.MF` to `bnd-maven-plugin` configuration (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1923[apache/logging-log4j2#1923])
