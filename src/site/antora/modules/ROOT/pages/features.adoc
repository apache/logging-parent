* https://antora.org/[Antora]-based site generation

[#cyclonedx-sbom]
=== CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

{project-name} streamlines the generation of https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vdr[CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)] using {cyclonedx-maven-plugin-link}.
Plugin execution is configured and activated to generate SBOM files for each module, including the root one.
Generated SBOM files are attached as artifacts with `cyclonedx` classifier and XML extensions, that is, `<artifactId>-<version>-cyclonedx.xml`.

Produced SBOMs are enriched with `vulnerability-assertion` references to a https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vdr[CycloneDX Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)] that Apache Logging Services uses for all projects it maintains.
This VDR is accessible through the following URL: {logging-services-url}/cyclonedx/vdr.xml[]

[#reusable-workflows]
== Reusable GitHub Actions workflows

Logging Parent publishes several
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows[reusable workflows]
that can be used from other repositories.

See xref:workflows.adoc[] for details.

[#release-instructions]
=== Release instructions

See following guides for projects employing {project-name} to cut releases:

* xref:release-review-instructions.adoc[]
* xref:release-instructions-project.adoc[]
* xref:release-instructions-xml-schema.adoc[]

[#develocity-configuration]
=== Develocity configuration

https://gradle.com/develocity/[Gradle Develocity] is a service that provides statistics and other improvements to the development experience.
Due to an
https://gradle.com/blog/apache-software-foundation-standardizes-on-gradle-develocity-to-improve-developer-productivity-experience/[agreement between the ASF and Gradle],
it is available for all ASF projects as INFRA hosted https://develocity.apache.org/[`develocity.apache.org`] service.

.Click for instructions to submit build scans to the `develocity.apache.org` server
[%collapsible]
====
. Add a `.mvn/develocity.xml` configuration file to the repository.
See
https://docs.gradle.com/develocity/maven-extension/current/[Develocity Maven Extension User Manual]
for detailed configuration options.
+
You can use the following example as template:
+
[source,xml]
----
include::example$develocity.xml[lines=1;18..-1]
----
+
[NOTE]
=====
Do **not** add any `.mvn/extensions.xml` file to the repository.
The file will be created by the `reusable-build` workflow.
=====

. Modify the build workflow that should publish build scans:
+
--
* Pass the `secrets.DEVELOCITY_ACCESS_KEY`, which is defined in all ASF repos as `DV_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret of the workflow.

* Set the `develocity-enabled` parameter to `true`.
--
+
For example, you can use the snippet below:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
build:
  uses: apache/logging-parent/.github/workflows/build-reusable.yaml@rel/{project-version}
  secrets:
    DV_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ ! startsWith(github.refname, 'release/') && secrets.DEVELOCITY_ACCESS_KEY }}
  with:
    develocity-enabled: ${{ ! startsWith(github.refname, 'release/') }}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
The Maven Develocity Extension is a **closed source** extension, which requires a commercial
https://gradle.com/[Gradle Inc]
license to work.
To guarantee the reproducibility of our builds and the security of our software suplly chain, please disable the extension in our **release** builds.
