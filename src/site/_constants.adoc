    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.tmpl.adoc` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT!

    `constants.adoc` is auto-generated from `constants.tmpl.adoc` during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence you must always,

    1. Edit `constants.tmpl.adoc`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-resources`
    3. Commit both `constants.tmpl.adoc` and `constants.adoc`
